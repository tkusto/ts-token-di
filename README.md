# TypeScript token-based DI container

Idea is about to have well-typed kind-of-DI container, 
that allows to compose program units in DI way, with no
"magic" things such as
[reflect-metadata](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reflect-metadata),
[non-standard decorators](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/decorators.html) etc.
